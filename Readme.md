Instead of using a custom graph storage this repository
contains implementations via lucene, tinkerpop, neo4j or/and others.

Warning: this repository uses an out of date version from graphhopper.
Contact me if you have interests in making this repo compatible with the latest version.
As I concentrate on core features this project is sadly no longer supported.

See [GraphHopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) for more information
